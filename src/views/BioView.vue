      Fuzztron is a 3-piece instrumental psychedelic rock band from Salida, CO. Mixing in elements of funk and jazz, we
      cover a musical spectrum not common in our local music scene. Some of what we play is rehearsed, but a lot of
      it is improvizational and many of our rehearsed songs go off on tangents we've never before explored. We often
      bring up friends to sit in ranging from guitar to keyboards/synth, harmonica, and saxophone, which add another
      layer to our sound. After nearly two years of playing shows from Leadville to Salida, and a slot kicking off
      FIBArk 2025 we're looking to keep playing shows and festivals in and around the Arkansas River Valley.

      When Monty's not picking guitar for Fuzztron he's likely in his garage going through an old tube amp, setting up a
      partscaster, or trying to coax some new sounds out of a guitar pedal. Music influences include Jimi, Jerry, Trey
      and beyond.

      Mikey grew up loving music and got his first drum set in high school, but he didn't really start playing until he
      was in his 20s. He mostly listened to grunge, classic rock, and metal until he got a taste for the jam band scene
      that expanded into jazz and all kinds of different music. He's been playing drums now for 20+ years. Most of his
      background playing with bands includes rock, jam band, instrumentals, punk rock, psychedelic funk fusion. Mikey
      absolutely loves playing music with all kinds of different human beings and continue to deepen his pocket with
      funky grooves.

      <img src="@/assets/images/zach.jpg" alt="Zach on Bass" class="float-left mr-4 rounded-lg w-52" />
      Zach grew up listening to his parents' classic rock records and glam/hair bands before figuring out what punk
      rock, metal, and hip hop were in the mid/late 80s. Shortly after that pivotal time was also when he got his
      first bass and never looked back. Prior to moving to Poncha Springs in 2020, Zach spent 20+ years on the Front
      Range playing in punk rock and metal bands. Most noteably, Straighten the Crooked and Sounds Like Words, both of
      which can be found on Bandcamp and Sounds Like Words has a few recordings on Spotify. Alongside Fuzztron, Zach
      also plays bass with Cookie Baker & the Morsels and formerly played with Santa Rios.
